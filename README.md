## About Me
- I'm a software engineer currently based in New York City.
- Recently I've been working with Angular & Typescript, but look forward to learning new languages and frameworks whenever I have the opportunity
- When I'm not programming, you can find me cooking, hanging out with my cats üêà‚Äç‚¨õ, or pursuing many different hobbies!
